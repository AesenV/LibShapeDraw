**Notice:** The demos have NOT been updated to 1.7 as Aesen's main interest is
to get the main API working again. If you would like to fix the demos, don't
hesitate to submit a pull request.

Each of these `mod_LSDDemo*` classes is a complete ModLoader mod... feel free
to copy-and-paste!

For more information about the LibShapeDraw API, see the
[main README.md](../../../../../../README.md#for-developers).

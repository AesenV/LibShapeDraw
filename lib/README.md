If you're attempting to build LibShapeDraw from source you will first need to
copy the contents of your Minecraft's `bin` directory to this directory,
including the LWJGL libraries and natives.

`minecraft.jar` should be vanilla with only ModLoader (or Forge) patched in.

You'll also need to create a `minecraft-deobf.jar` using MCP.

See `../README-contributing.md` for more info.

If you're attempting to build LibShapeDraw from source you will need to place
several jars in this directory:

 +  Copy the contents of your Minecraft's `bin` directory to this directory,
    including the LWJGL libraries and natives. `minecraft.jar` should be
    vanilla.

 +  Copy the Forge universal binary to this directory. Rename the archive to
    `minecraftforge-universal.jar`.

 +  Create `minecraft-deobf.jar` using MCP.

See `../README-contributing.md` for more info.

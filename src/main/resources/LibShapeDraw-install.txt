Installation instructions for ${project.name} v${project.version} [${minecraft.version}]:

Works exactly like any other Minecraft client mod.

Patch the contents of the jar file into your minecraft.jar, being sure to
remove the META-INF folders. Using a utility like Magic Launcher is highly
recommended; manually copying .class files is for the birds.

ModLoader (or Forge) is required.
